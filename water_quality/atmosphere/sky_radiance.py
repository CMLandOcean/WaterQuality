    as a weighted sum of three wavelength dependent functions, E_dd, E_dsr and E_dsa.In contrast to E_d, the two diffuse components are treated 
    separately since Rayleigh scattering has a much stronger angle dependency than aerosol scattering. The parameters g_dd, g_dsr and g_dsa are 
    the intensities (in units of sr−1) of E_dd, E_dsr and E_dsa, respectively." [1]
